## Heimskr üòé

I'm Kai Tamkun, a Computer Engineering master's student at UCSC.

#### Projects
- [Why](https://github.com/heimskr/why): an instruction set architecture, including tools like an assembler, linker and VM.
- [ll2w](https://github.com/heimskr/ll2w): a standalone half-compiler that compiles LLVM intermediate representation into Why bytecode.
- [BME680 Reader](https://github.com/heimskr/flipperzero-bme680): a Flipper Zero application to read data from BME680 sensors.
- [Algiz](https://github.com/heimskr/algiz): an HTTP 1.1 (+ WebSockets) server with a plugin architecture.
- [C+-](https://github.com/heimskr/c--): a language with more features than C and fewer features than C++ that compiles to Why bytecode.
- [Wahtw≈ç](https://github.com/heimskr/wahtwo): an abstraction layer that unifies inotify and FSEvents under a common C++ interface.
- [Spjalla](https://github.com/heimskr/spjalla): a terminal-based IRC client.
- [Reden](https://github.com/heimskr/reden): a GTK 4 IRC client.
- [PingPong](https://github.com/heimskr/pingpong): a C++ IRC library used in Spjalla and Reden.
- [Haunted](https://github.com/heimskr/haunted): a C++ terminal UI library used in Spjalla and the Why VM.
- [Formicine](https://github.com/heimskr/formicine): a C++ library for ANSI terminal escapes used in Haunted.
- [Thurisaz](https://github.com/heimskr/thurisaz): a kernel for Why written in C++. Abandoned due to performance limitations.
- [Thorn](https://github.com/heimskr/thorn): a kernel for x86_64 written in C++. On hold because AHCI is tricky.
- [Armaz](https://github.com/heimskr/armaz): a kernel for Raspberry Pi 4 written in C++. On hold because ARMv8 paging is tricky.
- [Untitled Game 2](https://github.com/heimskr/game2): a simple resource collection and trading game for GTK 4.
- [Untitled Game 3](https://github.com/heimskr/game3): another approach to the previous game's general idea, this time with actual graphics!
- [Probability Chess](https://github.com/heimskr/probchess) ([demo](http://heimskr.gay/chess)): a hastily made implementation of my chance-based chess variant.
- [RV32-Verilog](https://github.com/heimskr/RV32-verilog): a GTK 4 interface for Fernsicles's 32-bit RISC-V simulator.
- [Serial](https://github.com/heimskr/serial): a simple serial monitor.
- [Strender](https://github.com/heimskr/strender): a C++ library for hierarchical generation of strings.
- [mask](https://github.com/heimskr/mask): a C++ library for controlling Chemion glasses.
